  Searching for all trips with a given arrival time,
  returning full details of all trips matching the criteria (zero, one or more),
  sorted by trip id Arrival time should be provided by the user as hh:mm:ss. 
  When reading in stop_times.txt file you will need to remove all invalid times,
  e.g., there are times in the file that start 27/28 hours, so are clearly invalid.
  Maximum time allowed is 23:59:59

    // ciara: what structure/ how do we want to store the stop_times.txts when we read them in 
    
    // Ciara Says: For sorting by trip ID:
    // forgive me if im wrong but HO on quicksort or 3 way quick sort 
    // has worst case space conplexity of nlogn
    // average case time complexity is nlogN
    
    // Ciara: Radix sort seems like itll take too much memory & we're mot sure enough on range
    //but again shot in dark from myself
