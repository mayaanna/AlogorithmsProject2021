"""
  Searching for a bus stop by full name or by the first few characters in the name, 
  using a ternary search tree (TST), returning the full stop information for each stop matching the search criteria (which can be zero, one or more stops) 
  In order for this to provide meaningful search functionality please move keywords flagstop, wb, nb, sb, eb from start of the names to the end of the names
  of the stops when reading the file into a TST (eg “WB HASTINGS ST FS HOLDOM AVE” becomes “HASTINGS ST FS HOLDOM AVE WB”)
